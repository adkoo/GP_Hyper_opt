# Optimization of Gaussian Process Hyperparameters

Gaussian processes are a powerful tool for non-parametric regression. 
Training is performed by maximizing the likelihood of the data given the model. 

Here we compare our [TFGP code](Modules/tfgp_trainer) (based on Tensorflow) to the results using sklearn and Gpy packages.
