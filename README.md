# Optimization of Gaussian Process Hyperparameters

Gaussian processes are a powerful tool for non-parametric regression. 
Training is performed by maximizing the likelihood of the data given the model to find the best GP kernel hyperparameters. 

Here we compare our [TFGP code](Modules/tfgp_trainer.py) (based on Tensorflow) to the results using sklearn and Gpy packages.
